## Design Differences in Designer 2.0

### Left-Aligned Side Menu


The biggest change for users will be the look and placement of functions in Designer 2.0. The new version streamlines the design, left-aligning a lot of the previous buttons and functions.  
Most functions are now relocated to the left-hand side.  
![Designer screenshot highlighting toolbar](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41432408655379)  
The left side menu will also replace the pop-up window that was utilized for certain functions.  
The functions now in the left side menu include:  
* Position
* Layers, formerly called “Objects”
* Data Sources
* Animation
* Widget format options
* Settings
* Text
* And more  
For example, Animations controls will now appear in the left side menu.

# Disk Encryption

### In this article, we’ll walk you through how to set up Disk Encryption on your OptiSigns Players.


* [What You’ll Need](#WhatYouNeed)
* [How to Set Up Encryption on an OptiSigns Player](#EncryptionSetup)
* [How to Recover Data from an Encrypted OptiSigns Player](#RecoverData)  
Disk encryption is essential for protecting sensitive data, ensuring that even if devices are lost, stolen, or compromised, unauthorized individuals cannot access critical information. It aligns with enterprise security standards by enhancing data compliance, minimizing risk of data breaches, and safeguarding organizational reputation.  
With OptiSigns [**Pro**](https://shop.optisigns.com/collections/shop-page/products/optisigns-digital-signage-player) and [**ProMax**](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-promax-signage-player?_pos=1&_sid=5d9445a9c&_ss=r) players, you can take this very important step to safeguard your data. Here’s how.  
|  |
| --- |
| **NOTE** |
| The Disk Encryption feature is only available on OptiSigns Pro or ProMax players. |  
---

 ------- 

# Disk Encryption

## What You’ll Need


In order to use Disk Encryption, you’ll need:  
* An OptiSigns Pro or ProMax Player

# Disk Encryption

## How to Set Up Encryption on an OptiSigns Player


To get started, attach a keyboard to your OptiSigns Player. When booting up, rapidly press the **Up Arrow** to gain access to the Restore mode menu. It should look like this:  
![restore mode menu optisigns player](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/40212059658387 "ApplicationFrameHost_DOBZcmN4V9.png")  
Here, hit Factory Reset. You’ll be asked whether or not to enable encrypted disks. Type **Yes** and hit Enter.  
![enabling encryption restore mode](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/40212059660051 "ApplicationFrameHost_BNOVLclemr.png")  
It will ask you to create a password. Create one, then complete the Factory Reset.  
|  |
| --- |
| **! VERY IMPORTANT !** |
| The password you set up will be required to be input every time you wish to recover data from your drive. Make sure to save this password in a safe place that you’ll have access to, or else you will not be able to retrieve data from the device. |  
If you bring up Restore mode again, you should see the **Encrypted Boot** option there. This means you have successfully encrypted the OptiSigns Player drive. From now on, it will be booted with the encryption in place.

# Fixing Unexpected Screen Rotation & Incorrect Orientation with OptiSigns Android Stick


Some Smart TVs have auto-rotation enabled by default, which can also affect devices connected via HDMI, including OptiSigns Android Stick players.  
A few Smart TVs known to have auto-rotation enabled by default include:  
* Samsung Frame TV
* Samsung Smart TV
+ Neo QLED 4K (QN85B, QN90B, QN95B, QN900B, QN800B, QN700B)  
If you experience unexpected screen rotation or incorrect orientation when using OptiSigns on your TV screen, the issue may be due to the TV’s rotation settings.  
**There are Two Ways to Fix This:**  
1. 1. **Disable Auto-Rotation in the TV’s Settings**
* Open the TV’s Settings Menu
* Go to Display or Screen Settings
* Find “Auto-Rotate” or “Screen Rotation”
* Disable this option
2. **Adjust HDMI Input Settings for OptiSigns Players**
* From the TV’s Home Screen, navigate to the HDMI input where the OptiSigns Player is connected
* Press and hold the Select button
* Choose “Edit”
* Change the device name/type to “PC”  
This will ensure that the device follows the orientation settings configured in the OptiSigns web portal. If you have feedback on how to make the how-to guides better, please let us know at: [support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com)

### Naming Your Design


By default, each new design will be titled “Your new untitled design,” as shown below.  
![designer name entry](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42087941844243)  
We recommend changing this name as soon as possible, as, while it is possible to save a design with the default name, it will be hard to identify in your Assets folder.  
![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42282228321299)  
Once the design has been given a name, it will appear there throughout the design process.

|  |

![empty design saved notification](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42087941863315)  
Any time a change is made to your design without saving, a notification will appear in the Top Menu alerting you that you have unsaved changes:  
![unsaved changes notification](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42087941868819)

# Handle OAuth Authentication using API Gateway Pre-request Configuration

### In this article, we will explain how to set up a Pre-request to retrieve an OAuth 2.0 access token for connecting to an API using an API Gateway.


OptiSigns API Gateway allows for OAuth authentication via Pre-request. This gives users the capability to consume API that requires OAuth authentication or similar.  
To get started, you'll need to set up an API request. Hover over **Account Name → More****→** Click **DataSources**:  
![how to navigate to datasource](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39080869728915)  
From there, hit **Add Request**.  
![datasources add request button](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39080900410515)  
Create a **GET****Request** and input your API endpoint, then click **Pre-request:**  
![optisigns api request form pre-request](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39080869729555)  
Within the Pre-request field, input the following code:  
```
const body = {
"grant_type": "client_credentials",
"client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
"client_secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>"

};
const params = Object.keys(body || {}).map((key) => {
return key + '=' + body[key];
}).join('&');

const {data, headers} = await os.postRequest("<OAUTH_AUTHENTICATION_URL>", params,{headers: {'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}});
const token = 'Bearer' + data.access_token;
os.context.set("request.headers.authorization", token);
```  
**Notes:**  
* "grant\_type": Use "client\_credentials" ., because "client\_credentials" is the grant type in OAuth for server-side integration without user interaction.
* <CLIENT\_ID> and <CLIENT\_SECRET> refers to the user's code for the API being accessed, this will need to be provided by the user.
* <OAUTH\_AUTHENTICATION\_URL> refers to the URL the access token is being retrieved from. This URL will need to be provided by the user.  
Now configure the **Header**:  
![properly configured API header](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39080900411795)  
With this and the rest of the required fields filled out, you've properly configured your Pre-request. Hitting**Run Test** should return a **200 OK** Response.  
![successful api request](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39080869736211)  
If so, hit**Save**to finish your API Request.

# How to Use the Tableau App

### In this article, we’ll show you how to set up and use the Tableau app to display Dashboards on digital signs.


* [What You’ll Need](#WhatYouNeed)
* [Step 1: Set Up OptiSigns as a Connected App in Tableau](#Step1)
* [Step 2: Set Up Tableau Integration in OptiSigns](#Step2)
* [Step 3: Creating a Tableau Asset](#Step3)
* [Additional Notes](#Notes)  
With the Tableau app, it’s possible to securely display Tableau dashboards on your large TVs and screens. This can dramatically increase communication and information across office spaces.  
To do this, you’ll need to follow three steps:  
1. Set up OptiSigns as a Connected App within Tableau
2. Set up the Tableau Integration in OptiSigns
3. Create a Tableau Asset and Assign it to a Screen  
Let’s get started.  
---

 ------- 

# How to Use the Tableau App

## What You’ll Need


* OptiSigns [Pro Plus](https://www.optisigns.com/pricing) subscription or greater
* A screen, [set up and paired](https://www.optisigns.com/blog/how-to-set-up-digital-signs-with-optisigns-and-amazon-fire-tv) with OptiSigns
* Tableau Cloud account
* A fully created Tableau Report  
---

 ------- 

# How to Use the Tableau App

## Step 1: Set Up OptiSigns as a Connected App in Tableau Cloud


To view Private reports in OptiSigns, it needs to be set up as a **Connected App** in Tableau Cloud. If you’re only interested in displaying Public reports, this step can be skipped - however, we ***highly recommend*** it, as setting up this integration will allow you to use it for any future reports you want to display from this account. If you are only interested in displaying Public reports, though, feel free to [skip to step 3](#Step3).  
To begin, find your **Settings** tab within Tableau. Once there, click **Connected Apps** → **New Connected App**.  
![new connected app tableau](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250613919635)  
Select **Direct Trust**.  
![direct trust dropdown tableau](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250613922451)  
You’ll open the Create Connected App window. Here, you can give your connected app a name (we recommend “OptiSigns” so you know it’s for us), restrict its access, and provide allowed domains. For the purposes of this example, we’ll apply it to “All projects” and “All domains.”  
![create connected app window tableau](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250613923987)  
Once created, it will appear in a list of Connected Apps. Select the app.  
On this screen, you'll want to **Enable** the OptiSigns app by hitting the **Three Dots**. Then, you'll want to hit **Generate New Secret**:  
![Screenshot 2025-03-22 at 5.27.26 PM.jpg](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39672709375507)  
The blurred out values are your **Secret ID, Secret Value, and Client ID**. These values will be critical to setting up your integration with OptiSigns, so keep this tab open.  
With this information and the app Enabled in Tableau, we can configure the integration in OptiSigns.  
---

 ------- 

# How to Use the Tableau App

## Step 2: Set Up Tableau Integration in OptiSigns


Before starting this step, you should have:  
1. Your **Secret ID, Secret Value, and Client ID** from your Connected App in Tableau on hand
2. Your Connected App set to Enable  
When you’re ready to go, navigate to the **Integrations** tab within OptiSigns:  
![integrations tab optisigns](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250660697107)  
Under the Tableau section of the Integrations page, select **Add Connection**.  
![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39597853563283)  
The **Add** window will pop up:  
![add integrations window optisigns](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250613933203)
You’ll need to fill in 5 values:  
* **Name -** The name of the integration. Put whatever you want to help identify it.
* **Email -** The email associated with your Tableau account. This ***has to match***.
* **Client ID -** The Client ID from [the last step](#Step1).
* **Secret ID -** The Secret ID from the last step.
* **Secret Value -** The Secret Value from the last step.  
Last, make sure the **Active** box is checked. When unchecked, this saves the integration but does not activate it.  
Once these values are filled in, hit **Add**. We are now ready to create a Tableau Asset.  
---

 ------- 

# How to Use the Tableau App

## Step 3: Create a Tableau Asset and Assign it to a Screen


Now that we’ve got the Tableau integration set up, it’s time to create a Tableau asset. This asset determines how your report will show up on your screens.  
|  |
| --- |
| **NOTE** |
| See [**Note 2**](#Note2) if your workbook contains Broad Views. |  
First, find the report you’d like to display. Hit **Share:**  
![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39364492002579)  
On the Share View window, hit **Copy Link**:  
![share view copy link tableau](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250613936275)  
Now go back to the OptiSigns portal and hit **Files/Assets** → **Apps:**  
![optisigns files/assets tab app](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250613937555)  
Now find the **Tableau** app.  
![tableau app optisigns](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250660711955)  
Clicking the app will open this window:  
![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39597827693203)  
* **Name -** The name of your Asset. This is used entirely in OptiSigns and can be anything you like.
* **Tableau Shared Report URL -** This is where you’ll input the Share URL you copied earlier.
* **Update Interval -** Denotes how often the app will sync, measured in seconds.
* **Authenticate with Connected App Integration -** Tick this box if you want to use Private reports. Since we set this up in [Steps 1](#Step1) and [2](#Step2), we recommend ticking this box. If you skipped those steps and only want to use Public reports, no need to check the box.  
|  |
| --- |
| **NOTE** |
| Tableau Cloud only allows 600 Update Interval requests per user/hour. See [**Note 3**](#Note3) for more information and solutions on how to handle this. |  
Now it's time to authenticate your Shared Report URL with an appropriate Connected App Integration you set up earlier:  
![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39597827694099)  
* **Connected App Integration -** Select the integration [you set up in Step 2](#Step2) in this box.  
Once you input the **Tableau Shared Report URL** and have selected your Integration, hit **Save** and your report should appear as a Preview:  
![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39597827695763)  
Once you have tailored it to your liking, you can **Close** it. This will create a Tableau asset that can be added to a Playlist or directly assigned to a screen:  
![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39597853567251)  
In order to display different tabs of a report, select the tab you'd like to view on Tableau site, then hit **Share**, same way as before:  
![tableau report share](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39250660703635)  
You'll then create a new Asset with that Share link as the **Site URL**:  
![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/39597827698067)

## Additional Notes

#### Note 3:


[Tableau currently limits](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/to_site_capacity.htm) its maximum number of refresh requests to 600 per hour/user. This means you'll want to be careful on how you set the "Update Interval," especially if you have numerous devices wanting to display Tableau reports.  
We have several recommendations on how to handle this with multiple devices:  
1. Set the Update Interval to match the number of devices. For example, if you have 50 devices, you can have a maximum Update Interval of 5 minutes (300 s) for a single report. With more devices this Update Interval will need to be longer, with less, it can be shorter.
2. For using Reports in a Playlist, the Report will update each time it is played. You'll need to set the proper duration, factoring in the number of reports and the number of devices. For example, if you have 10 reports on a single playlist across 5 devices, you can have a Playlist duration of 5 minutes (300 s).
3. To scale beyond these limitations, you'll need to create more connected apps under different Tableau Cloud users. Each Tableau Cloud user will have 600 requests an hour.

# Legacy DataSources

### In this article, we’ll cover our Legacy DataSources - key-value pair formatting with Google Sheets or Microsoft 365 Excel


* [How it Works and When to Use Legacy DataSources](#HowitWorks)
* [Creating Data Mapping Elements](#Creating)
* [Generating a Google Sheet or Excel Document](#Generating)
* [Modifying the Data](#Modifying)  
Using Designer, it’s possible to assign a key value to an element, then map it to a Google Sheet or Microsoft Excel document. This will create a new spreadsheet directly mapped to the individual design. The values on this new spreadsheet can be modified to change what the design displays.  
![advanced datasources googlesheet or ms excel 365](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42915203035795)  
Please note that this is an older form of Data Mapping in OptiSigns. Now, with our new OptiSync feature, exsiting Google Sheets or MS Excell sheets can be directly integrated into a design with a simple drag-and-drop. It is also possible to directly connect APIs, JSON, XML, or custom tables. See our article on [**Dynamic Data Mapping using OptiSync**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29217646663187-How-to-Set-Up-Dynamic-Data-Mapping-with-OptiSync) for more information.  
---

 ------- 

# Legacy DataSources

## How it Works and When to Use Legacy DataSources


This form of Data Mapping follows these steps:  
1. Mapping data to individual design elements
2. Generating a Google or Excel spreadsheet of these elements
3. Altering the spreadsheet so changes are reflected on the design  
Different screens can be mapped to the same design so that, depending on where it’s shown, the values will be different.  
Legacy DataSources are particularly useful for pairing with our [**Scrolling Text**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/42436941395475-Widgets-in-Designer#ScrollingText) and [**Scrolling Vertical** widgets](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/42436941395475-Widgets-in-Designer#ScrollingVertical), and if you have numerous elements on a single design you wish to be dynamic.  
---

 ------- 

# Legacy DataSources

## Creating Data Mapping Elements


To get started, you’ll need to create a design. To do this, go to **Files/Assets → Apps → Designer**.  
For this example, we’ve used one of our [pre-built Templates](https://canvas.optisigns.com/) as the design. For yours, you can explore our 5000+ template library, or create a design from scratch. See our article on [**Getting Started with Designer**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/42087942047379-Getting-Started-with-Designer)if you need help.  
Now, we’ll need to add a Data Mapping to an element. Click the Element you want to map to your DataSource, then hit the **Settings** button. Then, click **Make Data Mapping**.  
![how to make data mapping](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42915219044243)  
The element will automatically be given an **Element ID.** We also recommend giving it an **Asset Element Name**, which will appear on your generated spreadsheet and can help identify what the value is.  
![data mapping element id and asset element name](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42915203032083)  
There are also additional options:  
* **Hide when data not available:** When no data is present on the sheet, nothing will display
* **Empty Data Handling:** When there is no DataSource element, the default behavior is to use the default value. You can adjust this with the following options:
+ **Use Default Value:** Show default content, which is what your element looks like originally.
+ **Use Blank:** Nothing will display.  
For more on the **Advanced Options** here, see [**Property Mapping and Display Format**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29217646663187-How-to-Set-Up-Dynamic-Data-Mapping-with-OptiSync#Property).  
Now, you’ll want to ***repeat this process for every element you wish to be dynamic***. Make sure you do this before you move on to the next step.  
---

 ------- 

# Legacy DataSources

## Generating a Google Sheet or Excel Document


Once you’ve mapped all the elements you want to be dynamic, it’s time to generate your spreadsheet. To do this, click the **DataSource** button on the Side Menu, then click **Add DataSource**:  
![how to add a datasource](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42915203033491)  
Scroll down in the popup to the **Adv. DataSources** section and choose either **Google Sheets (legacy)** or **MS Excel 365 (legacy)** depending on which you prefer.  
![advanced datasources googlesheet or ms excel 365](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42915203035795)  
Clicking one of these will bring up the option to sign in with your account of choice.  
![choose between google sheet or ms excel datasource](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42915203036819)  
|  |
| --- |
| **NOTE** |
| This requires a paid account for Microsoft 365, as the free account does not support this feature. Without a paid MS 365 account, we recommend a Google Sheet. |  
Give the Sheet a **Name**, then sign in to your preferred account. You will need to provide certain permissions for this to work. See our [Privacy Policy](https://www.optisigns.com/privacy-policy) for additional information.  
Next, you’ll be asked to provide the Folder for where you want your sheet to be saved. Select one, then continue. Your DataSource will be created:  
![authorized google sheets datasource example](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42915203039123)  
|  |
| --- |
| **IMPORTANT** |
| Data must be within a table if using Excel Sheets.  excel datasource table example |  
At this point, you can access your spreadsheet to see the elements you’ve mapped by hitting the **Open** button.  
![how to open google sheet in optisigns](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42915219091475)  
The elements you’ve mapped will appear in the sheet.  
![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42915219094419)  
---

 ------- 

# Legacy DataSources

## Modifying the Data


To change the mapping, simply edit the values in the columns, being sure to keep the Asset Element ID and Asset Element Name the same.  
For example, say we want the word “SOCIAL” to appear on one screen in one location, but we want it to say “COMMUNAL” in another. To do this, we simply duplicate the Row, then change the “Screen Name” and “Value” cells:  
![modified data in datasource](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42915203045779)  
The “Screen Name” will need to be the same as the name of the screen you’re targeting with the asset. This is equivalent to the **Device Name** under the **Edit Screen** tab:  
![device name on edit screen tab](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42915203048467)  
Some best practices:  
* OptiSigns will identify the screens by name and adjust the Value based on what's entered on your spreadsheet.
* If you change your screen's name, be sure to update your spreadsheet at the same time. If updated later, it could cause issues with data mapping on the screen at the next update interval.
* \*\*\*ALL\*\*\* tells OptiSigns that if a screen is not specifically assigned values, it will take value from this row of data. This is equivalent to the "Default Value" mentioned earlier in the article.
+ If a value is detected, it will override the \*\*\*ALL\*\*\* value, like in the example above.

## Identify Your Device


There have been several versions of the OptiSigns Android Stick over the years. The most common are the Gen 2 and Gen 3 devices:  
![android player comparison gen2 vs gen3](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/40147900608403)  
Functionally, these are quite similar. Both use the latest versions of the OptiSigns software. Most of their differences lie in **[Networking](#Network).**

 ------- 

# OptiSigns Android Player Troubleshooting Guide

## Best Practices


We recommend certain best practices to keep your OptiSigns Android Player running at peak efficiency:  
* Do not put too much pressure on the power cable, as this can cause the Player to get pulled from its HDMI socket.
* Keep the player in an indoor, air conditioned environment
* Run the Android Stick in fullscreen mode, or with a 2-3 zone Split Screen.  
By default, an Android Player has an [**Operational Schedule**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/28598173096723-How-To-Create-and-Use-Operational-Schedules-HDMI-CEC-RS-232) built in to ensure it has 8 hours of downtime per day:  
![operational schedule image](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/40147917435923)  
If you require 24/7 uptime, more than 3 zones on a split screen, a heavy Website Dashboard (including Tableau or Power BI reports), or plan to use the player in hot or cold environments, consider the [**OptiSigns Pro Player**](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-digital-signage-player) or [**ProMax Player**](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-promax-signage-player).

### Changing Device Time Zone


When **[setting a schedule](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016981853-Create-and-Using-Schedules-with-OptiSigns)**, it's critical that the portal and device share the same time zone. If the time zones are not identical, it can cause your schedule to start at a different time than you'd like. The issue is usually the device's time zone.  
To do this, you'll need to change it. Start by pressing the **Home button**on your remote (or hit **Exit App** from the Side Menu), and navigate to the **Settings** menu.  
![settings menu](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41497198237971)  
Select **Device Preferences**.  
![device preferences option android side menu](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41497175224851)  
Select **Date & Time**.  
![date & time option android side menu](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41497198242323)  
Select **Set time zone**.  
![select time zone option android side menu](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41497198243347)  
For some reason, Android devices lead with Midway Island, in the middle of the Pacific (some things in life are best left a mystery). Navigate to your preferred time zone and select it.  
![time zone options android](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41497198244627)

### How to Factory Reset the OptiSigns Android Player

#### Hard Reset


When certain Android system files are corrupted, the device will not be able to boot into the Android system. In this case, you will need to perform a hard reset.  
To perform one, you’ll need a small tool. Think paperclip, needle, or SIM card pin. Then, ensure the device is completely powered off and the USB power cable is unplugged from the device.  
Next, use your small tool to press into the small hole on the side of the device. Hold it, then plug in the power cable while the tool is still pressing the button in the small hole.  
![optisigns gen 3 player hard reset hole](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/40147900618259)  
The system will then boot into recovery mode. You can use the button to navigate between selections and will need to press and hold for 1-2 secs to confirm selection. Choose **wipe data/factory reset**, and the factory reset will start.  
![boot mode wipe data option](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/40147900620563)  
Then choose **Factory data reset:**  
**![boot mode factory data reset option](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/40147917447443)**

## Best Practices


* Set up the [**Mobile Admin App**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/30003143806099-How-to-Use-the-OptiSigns-Mobile-Admin-App). This will allow you to use numerous features remotely, including the Remote Keyboard app and remote monitoring.
* Keep the player in an indoor, air conditioned environment
* Ensure your player is up-to-date. We release frequent OTA updates - see more below.  
By default, our Pro Players are set to receive a weekly automatic OTA update at **Sunday 00:00** (also known as Saturday night). If the players are offline at that time, it’s possible to miss the OTA update. We recommend changing the OTA update to a time when the players are online, but not being used for anything mission critical.  
These OTA updates often bring with them new and advanced features, stability updates, security updates, patches, and more, so we ***highly recommend*** scheduling an update time that works for you. If none do, be sure to occasionally **Check for Updates**.

### Internal Website and Certificates


For installation on a Gen 3 Pro or ProMax Player, your certificate must have a **.crt** extension. However, it is important that this certificate is signed and contains your public key. These are usually generated as **.pem** files. You’ll need to rename your certificate (.pem) file and change its extension to **.crt** for your internal website to properly display.  
![certificate file option](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/40736684879635)
